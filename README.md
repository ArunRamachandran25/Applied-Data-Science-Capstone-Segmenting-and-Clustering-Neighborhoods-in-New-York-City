# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-New-York-City
In this lab, you will learn how to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, you will use the Foursquare API to explore neighbourhoods in New York City. You will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighbourhood, and then use this feature to group the neighbourhoods into clusters. You will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualise the neighbourhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.
